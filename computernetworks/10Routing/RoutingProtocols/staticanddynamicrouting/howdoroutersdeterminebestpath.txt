static routing - administrator decides best path
RIP = hop count decides which is best path.
OSPF = bandwidth decides which is best path.
EIGRP = bandwidth and delay.


when using RIP routing protocol - it would send the traffic directly from san francisco to san jose.
it will not take bandwidth into account. as hop count is the metric here. rip will take direct path between those networks.


OSPF would send traffic via new york because link speeds are greater. ospf makes better decisions.
RIP does not make better decision, it just looks at number of hops.

we will use either ospf or eigrp in modern networks.
eigrp is a proprietary cisco routing protocol

ospf is an industry standard, when we have a multi vendor network.
