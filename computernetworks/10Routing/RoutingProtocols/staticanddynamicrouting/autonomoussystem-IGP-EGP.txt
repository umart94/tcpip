Autonomous system is a grouping of networks under a single administrative domain
routers within an autonomous system are under control of a group of people or company.

1 autonomous system cannot allow some other AS to manage their network..
eg. coca cola and pepsi. (seperate autonomous systems)

various IGPs can be used within an AS. such as RIP,EIGRP,OSPF.



AS connects to ISP using BGP

within AS they may be using OSPF.

but between ASystems, BGP is used.


very large companies use BGP and receive routes from ISP using BGP.

ISPs which carry routes of customers in internet use BGP.

so ISPs also use BGP.

internally within AS they may be using OSPF and IS-IS etc.

each isp determines which routing protocol to use internally.


AS are similiar to registered numbers on the internet.

before connecting on internet using bgp, we have to register
within an AS no need to register.

as soon as we connect to internet, we have to use a publically ASN number.

this doesnt apply if we use static routes, or already an ISP assigned an ASN number to us..

if we want to create our own isp, asn number has to be registered.
