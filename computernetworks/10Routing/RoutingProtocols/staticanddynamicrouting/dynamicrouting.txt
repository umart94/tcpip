we can telnet to live bgp routers on internet

telnet route-server.ip.att.net

we can login with read only access to router.

show route summary

8.5 million routes with destinations


bgp is routing protocol used on internet

a small router is not going to be able to handle a large number of routes.

small routers will not handle those routes.

a default route will be used as a last resort , pointing device to a gateway of last resort.
similiar to default gateway on pc.

so we can use static routes upto a certain extent, after that on the internet we use dynamic routing protocols. ( large scale networks )

dynamic routing protocols such as ospf or eigrp are used to dynamically add or remove routes from routing table.

dynamic routing protocols
- use routing protocol
- automatically adjusts based on topology changes or traffic changes.

as soon as we enable a routing protocol such as ospf or eigrp
routers exchange information about networks with each other
and learn and maintain routes by exchanging routing updates.


OSPF uses link state updates to advertise / update routing information about networks
this puts overhead on network because additional traffic is sent by routers 
advantage is that it uses few commands

so dynamic protocols put less overhead on network administrators.
routers automatically learn about any network.
