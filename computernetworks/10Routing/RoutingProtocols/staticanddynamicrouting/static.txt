two ways in which routes get added to routing tables of routers

1. static routes - in which adminstrator manually enters route.
advantage is that no overhead on the network, no keep alives, no constant routing updates.

RIP sends entire routing table every 30 seconds.
when using static routes this overhead is removed

EIGRP and OSPF. remove this constant updating,
but they still send hellos and keep alives

static routing removes this

but admin has to update routing table if we have a large network. and if there is a topology change.

overhead is on administrator.
static routes do not scale when network becomes large, amount of work is too great. when lots of topology changes are present.

requires extra configuration and extra mechanisms.


static route = default static route.
home adsl cable router has a static route default to isp
home router does not know routes of the network

it simply forwards the traffic to isp
a default route in routers routing table that
when we dont have a specific network path, simply send packets to default gateway default static route.


Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.100.115
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.100.1


PC will send traffic to default gateway for any ip addresses not in the 192.168.100.0 subnet.


e.g C means directly connected networks


0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.56.1

we are adding a default static route to ip routing table of router,  with gateway of last resort being 192.168.56.1 , for any networks not in its routing table.

The local router forwarded traffic to 192.168.56.1 ( the gateway ) to get to dns server 8.8.8.8 and to ping google.com



2. dynamic routing protocols
