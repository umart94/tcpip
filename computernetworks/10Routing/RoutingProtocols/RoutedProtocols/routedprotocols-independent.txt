in ipv4 in image, we cannot ping since the routers are in a different subnet.

but using ipv6 we can ping these routers as they are in the same subnet.

so we can see that routed protocols are independent, seperate and different from another routed protocol.

routed protocols use different routing protocols

OSPF v2 used in ipv4

OSPF v3 used in ipv6
