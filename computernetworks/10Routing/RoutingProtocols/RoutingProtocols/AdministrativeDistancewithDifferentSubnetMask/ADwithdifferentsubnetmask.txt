subnet masks are different

Router4 is learning about the network 10.1.1.0/27 (RIP v2) AD of 120 from router 1 via Rip V2 --> RIPV2 detects (10.1.1.0/27)


Router4 is learning about the network 10.1.1.32/27 (RIP v2) AD of 200 from router 2 via BGP --> BGP detects (10.1.0.0/16)



Router4 is learning about the network 10.1.1.64/27 (RIP v2) AD of 110 from router 3 via OSPF --> OSPF detects 10.0.0.0/8

which way will router 4 send traffic if we ping 10.1.1.1 on router 4

Note that OSPF has lowest AD

in case of different subnet masks, the length of the route takes precedence over the administrative distance

AD is only used if multiple routing protocols are trying to put same route in routing table.

out of all three, network 10.1.1.0/27 is chosen as it has the longest match, 

the ping from router4 will go via router1 as it is longest match. ( taking subnet mask length into account)

even though it has higher AD than router3

if the subnet masks were same , then lowest AD will be chosen , i.e router 3
