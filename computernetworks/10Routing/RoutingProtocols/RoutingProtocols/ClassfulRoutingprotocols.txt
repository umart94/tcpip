classful routing protocols do not advertise subnet masks

example 
they would advertise network 10.0.0.0 only and not its subnet mask.

other routers would not know if network is 10.0.0.0/8 or 10.0.0.0/24

if 

pcA = 10.1.1.1
pcB = 10.1.2.1

are they on same subnet ?
that depends on mask
if /8 is used, then on same subnet
if /24 then not on same subnet


in classful routing protocols, the consistency of subnet masks is automatically assumed i.e
all networks are assumed to have same subnet masks. i.e
the router will assume that the other routers were also using the same mask as received in routing update.


if classful routing protocols receive the routing updates with network of  10.0.0.0 on an interface where ip address is configured with a /24 mask
the router will assume that the other routers were also using a /24 mask.

this is very dangerous

routers assume network consistency , so router assumes that everyone is using same mask and all masks are the same
this is not scalable or deployable in networks today

so classful routing protocols are not used e.g rip v1


classful routing protocols also summarize routes across classful boundaries.

so when we go from class a subnet to class b, routers will automatically summarize these routes to classful boundaries

in other words

classA = 10.1.1.0/24 will be summarized to 10.0.0.0/8

examples are ripv1 and igrp ( replaced by eigrp)
