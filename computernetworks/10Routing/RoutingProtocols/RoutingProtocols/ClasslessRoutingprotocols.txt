classless routing protocols do advertise the subnet mask, ( now subnet masks are considered different for 2 or more networks)

10.0.0.0/24 or 10.0.0.0/30

routers see exact network mask and do not work on assumptions

classless networks also support VLSM or variable length subnet masks I.E
masks of all interfaces do not have to be the same


classless networks also support manual summarization of routes.

examples:
OSPF (AREA BORDER ROUTERS OR Autonomous System Border Routers )
EIGRP
RIP v2
IS-IS
