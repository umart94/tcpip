Distance Vector
routing by rumor.

they determine direction and distance to a destination
direction is known as vector
distance such as hopcount is determined to any destination in the network.

RIP - hopcount to determine cost / distance to a network.

easy to configure.

major disadvantage to distance vector routing is that they have limited visibility.

its possible that routers may make incorrect decision based on routers of their neighbours.

this requires that a router inform its neighbours about changes detected in network periodically.

RIP updates routing table every 30 seconds.

distance vector means that routers advertise routes as a vector of distance and direction.

direction is represented by next hop address and local exit interface.

distance uses a metric such as hopcount in rip.

DVR do not have knowledge of entire path.

routing loops increase. thus multiple features have been introduced to stop routing loops.
router only knows the direction. and distance.
