have complete map of the area,
every router builds its own internal map of the entire network topology. in its link state, also called topology database.


each router then runs its own shortest path first algorithm. to calculate the shortest paths to all known destinations.


an example of a link state routing protocol is OSPF.

it uses cost as routing metric, based on bandwidth.

they cant make bad routing decisions, they have a full view of network topology.

they have full view of a path of network.

link state, this name means that each router originates information about itself. its directly connected interfaces or links.

this information is then passed between all routers. each router makes a copy, but does not change information..

so each router has same topological database of routes of a local network..


link state algorithms use Shortest Path first algorithm. such as OSPF and IS-IS.

difficult to configure, they require a hierarchial network topology

backbone area
area zero
and multiple other areas.

link state routing protocols
require more memory and processing power.

they maintain multiple tables.

such as neighbour table
link state database table
routing tables.

SPF algorithm can also be process intensive, thus link state routing protocols require more powerful cpus and more memory in routers than DVR do.
