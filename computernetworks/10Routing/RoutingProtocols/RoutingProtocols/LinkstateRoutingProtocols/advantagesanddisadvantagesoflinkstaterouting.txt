advantages 


fast convergence
changes reported immediately
robust against routing loops as routers know entire topology
link state packets are sequenced and acknowledged. within ospf
if an update is not received by a router , it will be retransmitted , rip does not form neighbour (peer) relationships but ospf does


so if one router sends an update to a peer neighbour and that peer does not acknowledge the reciept of the routing update
the router will retransmit the update

hierarchical design enables optimization of resources.

can scale to much larger environments than DVR .. large ISPS may run OSPF or IS-IS internally within Autonomous systems.


OSPF and IS-IS are preferred as they are more scalable.









------------------------------

disadvantages

drawbacks of link state routing
significant demand of resources.

require more
memory - adjacency , topology (LSDB database ) and forwarding table
cpu - more demand on cpu Djikstra algorithm is process intensive due to frequent link state changes  

requires strict design

OSPF

area 0 is always required when we have more than 1 area

all other areas have to touch the backbone area
all traffic from 1 area to another area has to traverse through backbone area.
