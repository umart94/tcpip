allow for division of large autonomous systems into smaller groups called areas.
routers within the autonomous system are in a common administrative domain

they are part of the same autonomous system

ospf Autonomous Systems  can be broken into multiple areas so that we have:

smaller routing tables
reduction of flooding of LSA
route summarization
efficient usage of resources.


the routers on boundary of AREA 0  and area 1 2 and 3 are known as area border routers, they have interfaces in other areas.


the routers within area 1, area2, area3 routers etc. and more are known as internal routers as they are only a part of single area.


the router that connects AREA 0 to the router configured with routing protocol is known as autonomous system border router. as it connects ospf to an
external autonomous system (RIP)

routers within area 0 are backbone routers, internal routers.

link changes in 1 area are hidden with other routers within other areas.


if a router went down in 1 area, that information will be hidden from routers in other areas.
they would not have to run the SPF algorithm again as they are unaware of the router going down.



this can be tested using totally stubby areas inside area2 and area3
we can also use route summarization to avoid to rerun spf algorithm in case a router goes down.

link state - contained within an area
summary  lsa - advertised to other areas as well

summary lsa are blocked by area border routers. so they dont go to other areas such as area2

to enable connectivity a summary route can be propagated in area2.
