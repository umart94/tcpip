link state routing protocols have greater visibility of the network and are more powerful than distance vector routing protocols.

flood network with LSAs. - Link State Advertisements

this information is flooded through entire network if in entire area recevied by all routers in the area.

all routers will create a topological database , it is the same on all routers in an area
this contains information about all routers in that area, links and states.
Link state routing protocol.. is the  link up or link is down..

routers run SPF algorithm shortest path first.

OSPF is a standard SPF algorithm

when the routers run SPF algorithm, they are at root of SPF tree and then calculate the best path or route from their perspective.

the best route for one router will be different for all routers.

SPF algorithm is run against the topological database.

Examples are : OSPF, IS-IS
