we need to install the virtualbox guest additions to make the display resize


Are the Official VirtualBox Guest Additions installed in the Guest?
The Guest Additions that came with VirtualBox 6.1.8.
If they ARE installed correctly the display resolution choices will NOT be grayed out.

If they are NOT installed, install them. First Remove any installed Guest Additions from other sources.

From the Guest's top menu bar:
Select ""Devices"
Select "Insert Guest Additions CD Image"
Navigate to the mounted CD image (best to use a terminal window, Konsole, etc)
Using elevated privileges, install the Linux Guest Additions:

CODE: SELECT ALL   EXPAND VIEW
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run


Note any error messages during the install.
The kernel headers for your running kernel have to be installed, as well as the C Compiler.
If these are not already installed, install them and try Installing Guest Additions again.

Edit:
Headers and compiler are required because some modules are compiled specifically for
your Linux kernel during the Guest Additions installation.

Edit 2:
Anytime the Guest kernel is updated, the Guest Additions should be reinstalled to ensure
kernel specific items are recompiled for the updated kernel.

VirtualBox Guest Additions installer
This system appears to have a version of the VirtualBox Guest Additions
already installed.  If it is part of the operating system and kept up-to-date,
there is most likely no need to replace it.  If it is not up-to-date, you
should get a notification when you start the system.  If you wish to replace
it with this version, please do not continue with this installation now, but
instead remove the current version first, following the instructions for the
operating system.

If your system simply has the remains of a version of the Additions you could
not remove you should probably continue now, and these will be removed during
installation.

Do you wish to continue? [yes or no]
yes
