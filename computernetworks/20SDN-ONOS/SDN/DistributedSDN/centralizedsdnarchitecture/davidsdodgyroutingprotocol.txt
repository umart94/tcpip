another problem that limits the automation of networking devices
is the fact that every device has its own proprietary operating system and
own proprietary networking interfaces.


S1 = HP comware SWITCH
S2 = HP provision switch
s3 = cisco switch

and so on from juniper etc.

its difficult to create a new application or to create a routing protocol
that is installed on every one of those devices


so if there is a new protocol lets name it DDRP 

it would be difficult for me to run this new routing protocol on multiple vendors

reason : 
1. there is no open interface on these devices that allow us to change the control plane,
and hence the data plane of these switches.

2. The Operating System Is Proprietary. and we have no access to the operating system.
and we can't change the OS to install a new routing protocol.

3. we cannot change the apis or interfaces on these devices because its proprietary
