how is the traffic forwarded through the device using data plane
traffic arrives at port 1 of switch 1 and is forwarded out of port2switch1

this information is programmed using the control plane inside a routing information
base or a mac address table as an example. where devices learn where the mac addresses are 
in a topology.

that information can then be pushed into hardware into the data plane

the control plane is typically running software

the data plane is a copy of the routing table as an example running hardware
to allow for high throughput forwarding of network traffic from one port to
another port

from a management point of view, each device has its own management plane
in other words you need to configure each device individually

if you had a 100 switches or 100 routers

we would have

100 control planes
100 data planes
and 100 management interfaces. to manage those devices.

we would need to connect to the cli of each device.
to configure for example ospf or spanning tree.
