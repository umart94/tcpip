OPENFLOW PROTOCOL TO ACCESS NETWORK DEVICE HARDWARE (flow tables of switches)
------------------------------------
NETWORK HARDWARE. (routers,swithces,firewalls,other devices)


if using sdn via apis.
different protocols could be used on southbound api
like
openflow
netconf
snmp
or other protocols

used to update switch tables.

openflow does not update the configuration of the network devices itself
like configure ospf, or configure usernames

it just updates flow tables of switches to manipulate how network traffic
flows through the network.



we can also have multiple controllers on the east as well as the west

so in northbound we had 1 single controller
now we can have multiple controllers on east and west as well.


southbound = control layer down to infrastructure
northbound = application and in between controller
east-west = is between controllers in control layer.
