pings
Start by opening the ONOS CLI console by double clicking on the ONOS CLI icon.
No pings? Why?
First, let's see whether two hosts can reach each other via ICMP ping. Go to your mininet prompt and type the following:
mininet> h11 ping -c3 h41



PING 10.0.0.16 (10.0.0.16) 56(84) bytes of data.

--- 10.0.0.16 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 2015ms

Well, there are no flows installed on the data-plane, which forward the traffic appropriately. ONOS comes with a simple Reactive Forwarding app that installs forwarding flows on demand, but this application is not activated by default. To see apps that are presently active, type the apps -a -s command and you will see the following output:

onos> apps -a -s
*  36 org.onosproject.optical-model        1.15.0   Optical Network Model
*  38 org.onosproject.openflow-base        1.15.0   OpenFlow Base Provider
*  39 org.onosproject.lldpprovider         1.15.0   LLDP Link Provider
*  40 org.onosproject.hostprovider         1.15.0   Host Location Provider
*  44 org.onosproject.drivers              1.15.0   Default Drivers
*  95 org.onosproject.openflow             1.15.0   OpenFlow Provider Suite
* 248 org.onosproject.layout               1.15.0   UI Auto-Layout
* 255 org.onosproject.proxyarp             1.15.0   Proxy ARP/NDP


we need to enable reactive forwarding app

In the same ONOS CLI window, type the following to active the Reactive Forwarding app:
onos> app activate org.onosproject.fwd
Activated org.onosproject.fwd

app activate org.onosproject.fwd

You have now seen that you can activate applications into ONOS dynamically. Actually you can also deactivate applications while they are running so, for example, let's do this. Note that you can ommit the org.onosproject prefix and use fwd for short.
onos> app deactivate fwd
Observe that the ping has now stopped. This is because when the reactive forwarding application has withdrawn any flows it has installed before it stopped. We'll talk more about this in the next section. For now, let's activate the app again.
onos> app activate fwd
