hosts can be manually configured with an ip address or automatically

if we use subnet mask of 24 in a subnet, then for 254 hosts we would have to manually configure ip of each machine.

we configure only 1 server to provide ip addresses to multiple PCs


DHCP is a client server model
DHCP Server is providing ip addresses to a Client, PC or IP phone etc.

device requests from dhcp server
dhcp server allocates ip address for limited period of time with some other parameters.

this allows for reuse the use of ip addresses by multiple devices 

Client
device requires initialization parameters from dhcp servers.


DHCP 3 Mechanisms

Automatic Allocation - DHCP server assigns a permanent address to a client. - lease set to infinity. - lease does not expire.
in automatic allocation we create a pool and scope of addresses that are allocated on first come first serve basis.

once device gets this ip it always will use this ip address.




Dynamic Allocation - DHCP server assigns an address to a client for a limited period of time. in IP telephony a least period of 7 days is used.
least period can be set to 1 day. ( sales people in an office using lot of devices. )

dynamic allocation allows for reuse of an ip address. to another device.


Manual Allocation - 
once device gets this ip it always will use this ip address.
adminstrator configures a pre allocated ip address to a single device.

when a device with a mac address connects, we configure on the dhcp server the ip address and then convey this ip address to the client machine on the network. ( a single device )
in manual configuration we have to manually configure the mac address and the ip address that is going to be allocated for a client.



these allocation methods are specific configurations on DHCP Server and NOT on the client PC.
