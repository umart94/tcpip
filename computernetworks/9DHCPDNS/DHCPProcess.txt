When a client device boots up, it notes that it does not have an ip address.
it will send a dhcp discover message, which is a broadcast
client does not know which subnet it belongs to

client sends broadcast to 255.255.255.255 to the whole network.

when DHCP server receives this message, the dhcp server responds with a DHCP OFFER MESSAGE.
this is unicast and contains initial configuration such as IP ADDRESS, SUBNET MASK, DEFAULT GATEWAY DNS etc.)

client and server are on different subnet - unicast.
client and server on same subnet - can be a broadcast message. lease offers and lease acknowledgements are sent as brooadcast messages


Multiple dhcp servers may respond , typically client sends dhcp request message to the first respond message it receives from a dhcp server. indicating to accept the parameter.



DHCP server then acknowledges that request and thus completes the initialization process.

ipconfig /release
this will generate a new ip address.


ipconfig /renew
this will renew ip address.

DHCP predecessor was BootP

wireshark uses bootp as filter for dhcp requests.

src port = bootpc (68) port and dst port bootps (67) [ bootp client and bootp server ]

command ip-helper-address 10.1.1.1 ( this address will receive the broadcast messages for the dhcp requests )
