subnetting and access lists

e.g
10.1.1.0/24
change to
10.1.1.0/28

access lists use inverse masks

0.0.0.255
inverse of 255.255.255.0


0 = Off
1 = On

so 2 cables
2 states per cable

gives 2^nStates

2^2 = 4 states

00 = both cables off current
01 = 1 cable on current
10 = 1 cable on current
11 = both cables on current


Eight Cables, ipv4 consists of 4 , 8bit values

since there are 8 bits

and 2 states OFF,ON

we have 2 ^ 8

2^ n

n = no if bits

2^8 = 256
