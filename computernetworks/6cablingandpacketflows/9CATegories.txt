Higher cable categories have :
more twists
less susceptible the cable is to electromagnetic interference
the more stringent specifications for cross talk and system noise

CAT1 - Telephones and Modems - unshielded twisted pair cabling - not suitable for data transmissions - no longer used
CAT2 - used for telephone and datanetworks upto 4mpbs - no longer used
CAT3 - previously used for networks upto 10Mbps Now generally used for telephones. - no longer used
CAT4 - defined upto 20Mhz with speeds upto 16 Mbps - no longer used
CAT5- defined upto 100Mhz speeds of 10/100Mbps supported longer cable runs of 1Gbps an issue.
CAT5e - improvement over cat5 defined upto 100Mhz supports 1 Gbps.
CAT6 - defined upto 250Mhz supports 10Gbps - 55meters. - standardized cable for gigabit ethernet. - crosstalk and system noise.
CAT6a - defined upto 500Mhz supports 10Gbps - 100meters.
CAT7 - defined upto 600Mhz support 10Gbps - 100meters. - classF - classFA
CAT7a - defined upto 1000Mhz, supports 100Gbps. 
CAT8 - supports 40Gbps.
CAT8.1 - backward compatible and interoperable with CAT6a
CAT8.2 - interoperable with cat7

generally - are used
CAT6 - defined upto 250Mhz supports 10Gbps - 55meters. - standardized cable for gigabit ethernet. - crosstalk and system noise.
