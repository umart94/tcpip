mac address is 48 bits in length

A is sending traffic to C

SourceAddress :A , Destination: C

hub is a multiport repeater - it amplifies the signal and sends signal out of all ports except the port on which it was received.

after that the Network interface cards would check that what is the destination address in the signals / frames.

other NICs would discard the frames.

device C NIC would then send the ipv4 packet to the upper layers to process that handles ipv4 packet.

So B and D will see all the frames sent between A and C


So physically HUB topology is a star.
but logically HUB topology is a bus.

its a single collision domain as you increase the number of devices in the network the collisions will increase.


Single broadcast domain
broadcast will be received by everyone.

10baseT
10Mbps is not dedicated , it is shared

so if there are 4 devices, 10 Mbps is shared = 10/4 * 30% = 0.75 Mbps.
