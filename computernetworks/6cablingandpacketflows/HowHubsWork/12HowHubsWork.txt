Hub - 10BaseT

Hub is a layer 1 device
CAT5 unshielded twisted pair cable to connect laptop to a port on hub

Wireless works on the same way as a physical hub would.

multiple devices can be 


4 Devices connected to a hub from ports 1 through 4

devices are A,B,C,D -- hub is not intelligent -- it doesnt understand frames going through it
it is a multiport repeater.

frames received at 1 port are repeated at all other ports.


physical topology is star

devices hanging off that central device.

if A wants to communicate to B traffic goes through hub.

if a cable breaks - it would only affect that device.

other devices can still communicate.

Bus topology is limited in size.


distance between device and Hub in the hub star topology needs to be 100 meters.
we can extend distance by adding another multiport repeater - and repeat the signal - to distances greater than 100 meters.
