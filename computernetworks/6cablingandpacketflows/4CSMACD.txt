in ethernet devices use CSMA CD

when a device wants to send traffic .. it checks to see if anyone else is transmitting
this is called carrier sense


multiple access means that any device can communicate across that segment.

in ethernet , distributed environment without taking permission from any device.

collision detection
in ethernet every device is independent of other devices.

detect collisions..
a device sends a backoff or jamming signal to indicate that collision has taken place.

terminators are used to indicate signals do not bounce back.

in a given scenario two devices communicate at exactly the same time.
then


A - B - C - D 

A wants to communicate with C
D also wants to communicate with B

carrier sense is used.

both a and d send traffic onto network
only 1 signal is allowed across the network (so collision in 10base2)

after collision devices wait for random time called random backoff time.

probability of collisions becomes greater as cable length increases and more devices connect.
