10base2 - coax cable - maximum speed of 10 megabits per second.
10 indicates 10 megabits
2 indicates max segment length of 185 meters
base indicates baseband instead of broadband


-------------------


baseband allows only a single signal to traverse along the line
the signal uses all the frequencies.


broadband uses coax cable
multiple signals to be sent across

-----------------------

Ethernet uses baseband signalling

in 10base2 coaxial cables were used
DNC connectors are used.
T connector is used.


single cable would have dnc t connectors
devices would connect to these t connectors 

at the end there is terminator to stop signal from bouncing back


baseband only allows a single signal.. so signal will not bounce back if terminator is used.

---------------------------

MAC Address = 48 bits.
unique identifier assigned to network interfaces.

built in by manufacturer.
first 24 bits are OUI portion Organizational Unique identifier identifies a vendor ( cisco , dell , hp ) 
rest 24 bits are station address
these station addresses should be unique.. designed by manufacturers.

on ethernet all devices have different mac addresses.

in OUI 1st octet 8 bits
the last bit from right ( LSB ) bit1 .. is either 0=unicast , or 1=multicast
bit2 is 0=globally unique or 1=locally administered.
