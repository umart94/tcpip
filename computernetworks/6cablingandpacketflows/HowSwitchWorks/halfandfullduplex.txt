In Switch , traffic is not shared.

10Mbps means that each device gets dedicated 10Mbps bandwidth.

we can increase the speed using duplex.


half duplex - only 1 party can talk at one time. - end with the word over. - walkie talkie.
Full Duplex means that we can send and receive traffic at the same time. - landline telephone

switches use full duplex
hubs use half duplex

when we use full duplex. we dont need collision detection - it is disabled - and csma is used only and not CD. (in csma/cd)

this causes issues when we use half on one side and full on other side.


speed can be negotiated

pcs have gig ports. bandwidth increases from 0.75 mbps to 2 gbps when using a hub.

throughput of switch is greater, so switches are used.

in wireless networks access points tend to act like hubs, in shared infrastructure. which means shared bandwidth.

in switches we have dedicated bandwidth.
