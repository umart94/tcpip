switch - layer 2 device
advantage is that ports are high in number
also processing is done at hardware level using ASICS


no degradation performance between two devices

can move traffic at wire speed

Mac address table

star topology

switch learns where devices are , stores mac addresses in mac table.


A port - 0/1
C port 0/3


Each interface on a switch is a seperate collision domain

4 ports means 4 collision domains

hub is also a single collision domain


switch is a single broadcast domain
broadcasts are flooded out of all ports


frame consisting of 8 F's floods it out of each port.
broadcast is supposed to go everywhere.

broadcast address is never addes to mac address table .
