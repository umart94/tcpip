longer the cable length - the greater the signal degradation
cable break - if someone broke the cable host a cannot communicate with another host

signals get reflected. if terminators are not used causing collisions in the network.

10base2 is 10megabits per second
its not 10megabits for each device - this is shared between the devices on that network
we can only use 30 to 40 %
collisions increase if we use it more.

10Mbps is shared.
10/4 * 30% = 0.75 Mbps.

as more devices are added , bandwidth decreases. called single collision domain

if collision occurs all devices suffer it and send backoffs.
