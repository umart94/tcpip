on a switch - a frame is forwarded out of a port
on a router - a packet is forwarded out of a port

Types of Communication

1. Unicast
one device communicates with one other device - one to one communication
one server - communicates with one client



2. Multicast
one device to some devices.
broadcast send traffic to people that dont want traffic
multicast sends traffic to only the people that subscribe to traffic.
they wont receive the traffic if they 




3. Broadcast
one to all communication
one server - communicates with many clients
broadcasts are dropped by layer 3 and 2 devices in networks. they degrade network traffic.

can be useful.
if 2 windows machines are configured with same name, broadcast is sent to networks.

in ipv6 broadcast support is removed.
