in a Bus Topology - each device is connected to a single cable ( shared communications line bus)
clients share communication line or bus
similiar to telephone party line

single cable and multiple telephones would be there
before we call we listen, if no one else was using the line

all telephones connected to the line would ring


all devices receive frames from any device.


10 base5 - thinnet - 500 meters segment size
10 base2 - thinnet - 185 meters - bus topology

when device sends a signal on line, all devices receive the signal



10base2 - coax cable - maximum speed of 10 megabits per second.
10 indicates 10 megabits
2 indicates max segment length of 185 meters
base indicates baseband instead of broadband


-------------------


baseband allows only a single signal to traverse along the line
the signal uses all the frequencies.


broadband uses coax cable
multiple signals to be sent across
