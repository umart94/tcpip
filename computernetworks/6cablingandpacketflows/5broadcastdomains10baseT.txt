when a device receives a broadcast it will process it on NIC and forward it to upper layers.

CPU of a PC would be interrupted.
if device A starts sending many broadcasts onto the network it would be received by all devices on the network
and PC's would be interrupted.


C and D will also receive broadcast from A and cpu of c and d will be interrupted.

10base2 was thus replaced with 10baseT
T means twisted pair
twisted pair ethernet
insulated copper wires with pairs - max distance of 100 meters.
we use unshielded twisted pair cables.

RJ45 connectors.
