A is on port 1
C is on port 3

now bridge knows A and C ports and mac addresses.

subsequent frames will only now use the port1 and port3

advantage is that a and c can communicate without disturbing b and d

and without using bandwidth of port 2 and 4.


each port on bridge is a different collision domain
4 ports means 4 collision domains
collision on any port means only traffic on that port will be affected and not other ports

similiarly if a 
hub is connected to port 4 , a hub is a single collision domain , so devices connected to hub will be affected. but not port 4 of bridge.

A ,B AND C have dedicated links to the bridge, have a single broadcast domain but there are 4 collision domains for 4 ports of bridge.


D and E are sharing bandwidth because they are connected to a hub.

bridge is a single broadcast domain if a sends broadcast all devices will receive broadcast.
