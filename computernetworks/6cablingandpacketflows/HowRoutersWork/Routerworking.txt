router is a layer 3 device - network layer
route decisions made on IP Addresses.

routers still use mac addresses on ethernet interfaces.
decision making based on ip addresses.

router also has serial and ethernet interfaces

serial interface - uses PPP
ethernet uses - MAC addresses.

PC A - MAC ADDRESS A - IP 10.1.1.1
ROUTER 2 INTERFACES - FIRSTETHERNET 0/0 - MAC ADDRESS G - IP ADDRESS 10.1.1.100
FIRSTETHERNET 0/1 - IP ADDRESS OF 10.1.2.100 - MAC ADDRESS H

SUBNET MASK OF /24 

255.255.255.0

BOTH PC A AND PC C ARE CONNECTED TO HUB CONNECTED TO ROUTER FA 0/0

PC B AND D CONNECTED TO HUB CONNECTED TO ROUTER
ROUTER INTERFACE IS FA 0/1


SUBNET OF A AND C IS SAME

SUBNET OF B AND D IS SAME

using ip address command subnet mask is set.


Routing table

TO SEND NETWORK TO THIS NETWORK- IP of 10.1.1.0/24 - PACKETS NEED TO BE SENT OUT OF THIS INTERFACE (FAST ETHERNET 0/0) F 0/0
TO SEND NETWORK TO THIS NETWORK- IP of 10.1.2.0/24 - PACKETS NEED TO BE SENT OUT OF THIS INTERFACE (FAST ETHERNET 0/1) F 0/1


------------------------------------

Device A sends traffic to device C - i.e. ping 10.1.1.2

but device a needs to know the mac address of device c

first device a checks local arp cache to see if there is a mapping of device c ip to mac address.

device a sends arp request message to network segment called a broadcast


SA: A,DA: FFFFFFFF


255.255.255.255       ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff     static
this is a broadcast address.
equivalent layer2 address is 8 Fs
