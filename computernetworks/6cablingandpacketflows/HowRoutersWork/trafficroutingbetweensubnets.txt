when a device wants to communicate with another device within the same subnet
it sends a broadcast onto the local segment (ARP REQUEST) to find MAC Address of the destination device. (while knowing already the ip address)

it looks like

Who has 10.1.1.2 tell ..


NIC only accepts unicast traffic sent to their mac address
or they accept broadcast traffic as well as accepting multicast traffic.


Router does not accept broadcast traffic.. it is disabled

so within subnet. the NIC of C device receives frames from device A 
and replies with a ARP reply.

Destination Address is : A so router will drop the packet.


when a receives frame it will receive it, update its arp cache,

with ip entry of Device C ,and Mac Address of Device C

no user traffic is transmitted
devices have simply worked out which mac address is associated with which ip address.


ping echo message is unicast message from machine to router
and from router back to the PC.
