A is pinging B

we are using /24 subnet mask

a ip is 10.1.1.1
b ip is 10.1.2.1

so router first checks the ip address of A vs B subnet mask whether it is in the same subnet.
it does this by doing a logical AND using network mask.

network portion is different.
so traffic is sent from Device A to the local gateway and then sent to remote device.

Device A must be configured with the local gateway of router. - 10.1.1.100

Device A does this by sending the broadcast ARP request. to the local gateway first WHO HAS 10.1.1.100 tell 10.1.1.1

ARP request to lookup the mac address of local gateway.

the Hub floods it out of all the ports PC C will drop arp request using destination address.

the router receives this arp request. using destination address.

and router replies with arp reply - unicast address.

packet goes to device a at 
Layer2
then layer3

now pc a has a mappping for mac address of router.


PC can send traffic to the network

but note that the mac address is of the local network segment.



now Router sees destination address and it sends out of fast ethernet interface FA 0/1 - MAC ADDRESS H

now suppose if the router does not know mac address of 10.1.2.1 - it will then send a broadcast message so that it can find the mac address of the device 10.1.2.1 i.e device B

SOURCE ADDRESS : H , DESTINATION ADDRESS: FFFFFFFF , SOURCE ADDRESS = 10.1.2.100 , DESTINATION  ADDRESS = 10.1.2.1


SO NOW HOST b WILL RECEIVE THE arp request and send back an arp reply to the hub

it goes from hub to router interface H
and now traffic can go from router to hub

hub will again flood it out of all ports

now packet arrives at Device B and router knows mac address of device B.


SOURCE ADDRESS : H , DESTINATION ADDRESS: B , SOURCE ADDRESS = 10.1.1.1 , DESTINATION  ADDRESS = 10.1.2.1


When we ping  the layer 2 information is updated at each hop, but the layer 3 information remains the same.
when we move from one vlan to another on switch or 1 interface to another on router, the layer 2 information is updated at each hop, but the layer 3 information remains the same.
