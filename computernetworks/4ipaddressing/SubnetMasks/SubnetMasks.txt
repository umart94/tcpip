Network Address

used to determine which portion of IP Address is the network portion and which part is the host portion

IS A Device remote or local ?

if two pcs are on the same subnet then they can communicate
without the default gateway.

but if these two devices are on different subnets different networks they need a default gateway


Local VLAN
Inter-VLAN Routing
or Route traffic through traditional routers.

e.g layer 3 switch may route between 2 vlans
or router may route this traffic

If they are in different subnets

Question : How to determine That 2 Devices are on the same subnet 
or they are on the different subnet / network ?


10.1.1.1 and device 10.1.2.1 are on the same subnet If

they are using the same mask /16

if they are using a /24 mask that means that the devices are on
different subnets



Determine:

if the 2nd Device is Remote:
Thus can be reached through default gateway - diferent subnet

if the 2nd device is Local:
and Therefore does not require use of default gateway - same subnet




Class A B AND C networks have default masks also known as natural masks


Class A : 255.0.0.0
Class B : 255.255.0.0
Class C : 255.255.255.0



10.1.1.1 = 00001010.00000001.00000001.00000001
255.0.0.0 = 1111111.00000000.00000000.00000000
in any network mask continouous 1's in network portion indicate network.
and continuous 0's indicate host.
NETWORK.HOST.HOST.HOST


1. Any address bits which have corresponding mask bit set to 1 represent network ID
2. any address bits that have corresponding mask bits set to 0 represent the node ID


Network ID = 10
host ID = 1.1.1

Network is 10.0.0.0

1.1.1.1 255.255.0.0

1.1.1.1 = 00000001.00000001.00000001.00000001
255.255.0.0 = 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000

NetworkId = 1.1
host ID = 1.1

Network is 1.1.0.0

to work out if another host is local
- check the network portion of the address.
- compare to the other host.

If the network portion is same, they are local devices.
if network portion is not the same, the devices are remote devices.


the network id is checked using Logical AND
and the local devices communicate using arp message directly, and not default gateway.

if the subnets are different the devices send data to default gateway. and use router to communicate.
