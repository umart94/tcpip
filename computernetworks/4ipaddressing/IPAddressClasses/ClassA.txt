start with a binary 0
Binary Range


In the First Octet combinations are from 0 to 127

THE FIRST BIT IN NETWORK PORTION IN CLASSA, IS SET TO BINARY 0.

RANGE FROM:

BINARY			DECIMAL
00000000			0
TO
01111111			127	



0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255

since 8 bits are reserved for the network
AND FOR CLASSA , WE SET THE 1ST BIT IN NETWORK TO 0

SO WE HAVE

2^7 = 128

0.0.0.0 is the first address in ClassA Range
127.255.255.255 is the last address. ClassA Range



in Class A , 127 is reserved for Loopback
we cannot configure any IP with 127.0.0.1 manually its reserved.

0 network is reserved for default network 


Actual Range of Class A is 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255.255 in the first octet


in class A


the first 8 bits denote network
the remaining 24 bits denote Host


10.1.1.1 implies that this is a classA address in which

00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000
NETWORK.HOST.HOST.HOST
