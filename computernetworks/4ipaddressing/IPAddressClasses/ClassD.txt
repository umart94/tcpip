Class A,B,C = Unicast
Class D = multicast

the 0 is in 4th bit position

a multicast address starts with a binary 1110

11100000 = decimal 224

with multicast addresses , the first octet

First Octet Binary 		First Octet Decimal
11100000					224 (Start)
11101111					239(End)

239.1.1.1 is a private multicast address

OSPF uses multicast 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6
these are Link Local Multicasts
they do not propagate off the local link segment
multicasts in this range are used by routing protocols

this implies that 1 device is talking to a group of devices.
