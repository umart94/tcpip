ipv6 does not use address classes
in ipv4 we have replaced classes with CIDR Notation

----------------------------

done to accomodate different sizes of networks
classifying networks
determined by IANA



-----------------
in Class A, Each Address has 16 million IP Addresses
e.g
18.0.0.0/8 reserved by MIT
etc.


the slash /8 means 8 network bits.

so 32 total
8 for network
32 - 8 = 24 bits for HOST

------------

classful addresses were replaced by CIDR in 1993


some commands still use classful address format

e.g network command RIP
