A Device can send a message to itself

this is used to let a system send a message to itself
this is useful to make sure that
the tcp/ip stack is installed correctly on a machine.


127.0.0.1 is a typical localloopbackaddress

note that anything in 127 range is deemed a loopback address

Class A Address

so 127 range had 16 million addresses that could be allocated

we lost these.

in IPv6 ::1 is used as loopback

Routers and switches also have loopback addresses

ROUTER LOOPBACK INTERFACE
---------
The loopback interface is useful because it is an interface with an IP address which never goes down. OSPF, without a specifically defined Router ID, will pick a Router ID on its own. It chooses the Router ID from the IP addresses of the configured and enabled interfaces. A loopback is a good choice since the loopback interface is always up unless someone specifically shuts it down. Other interfaces may go down if there is a problem on the link.
