used by hosts to send data to all devices on a specific network
Entire host portion filled with binary 1s


so 255 means that the entire octet filled with 1s


We are working with Octets

1 Octet = 8 Bits.

if you use 2^8 that is 256
if you fill all 1s that value is in decimal 255 and in binary 11111111


256 takes 9 bits. = 100000000
this is why we do not use 256 value in networking

so we are limited to 8 bits per octet.

172.31.11111111.11111111

ClassB network
network = 172.31
host = 0.0
Network 172.31.0.0
directed broadcast = 172.31.255.255
device = 172.31.0.1







Routers can route directed broadcast
but this is disabled by default.

this address is used in DoS attacks , if we enable the routing 
on directed broadcast address... so forwarding of directed broadcasts is disabled.

if forwarding of directed broadcast was enabled on the router then

e.g that attacker is on subnet 172.16.0.0
ip of device of victim is 172.16.0.1
ip of device of attacker is 172.16.0.10

attacker is on same network as victim.

from 172.16.0.10 attacker sends directed broadcasts to 172.31.255.255 address which is broadcast address of another network. With a changed source address of 172.16.0.1


All devices on 172.31.0.0 would then reply to the device 172.16.0.1
causing DoS attack on that device.
