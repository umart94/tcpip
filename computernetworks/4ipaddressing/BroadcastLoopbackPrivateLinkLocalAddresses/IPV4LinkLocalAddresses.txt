Dynamic configuration of ipv4 link local addresses
RFC3927

APIPA

used when PC configured for DHCP but no server is available


this allows PCs to use link local addresses for communication
range

169.254.0.0/16
255.255.0.0

in the old windows versions , we had to
allocate address using dhcp
and manually configure the ip address
so 2 pcs can communicate.


so we can communicate between two devices through ethernet cable

the hosts can communicate on the local link , but the traffic will
not be routed

only for communication on the local net this method will work

but for devices on other subnets, other networks this will not work
