Google - OpenFLOW

network utilization to 100 %
why they used openflow in core network

reason is networking costs do not go down as you scale up.

this is in contrast to compute and storage.

datacenter at scale, we need savings.
but cost of networking stayed linear and increased.


this is different to compute and storage, where the price went down
as you scaled.

by implementing openflow and sdn google were able to manage many networking devices as a single unit rather than lots of individual networking devices.
