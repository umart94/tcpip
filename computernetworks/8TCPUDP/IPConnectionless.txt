internet protocol is connectionless
every packet is treated individually and seperately


if the pc is communicating to the server, it can take multiple paths.
traffic can arrive out of order.

if pc sends packet1,packet2,packet3

packet2 can arrive before packet1

so 2,1,3 is order.

IP does not guarantee the delivery of packets. or their orders

the higher layer protocols need to ensure the reordering of packets.
