PC A initiates a connection oriented session with PC B
protocol software modules of host devices send messages across network to verify transmission is authorized 

3 way handshake between host devices.


Step1
Host initiating transmission sends SYN flag to Host B and host a chooses a initial sequence number of suppose 100. with 

control flag = syn = 1flag.
this session also establishes the port number to connect to.


Step2
when syn is accepted by B, B sends SYN,ACK flags set. 

control flag = SYN=1,ACK=1 B also sets initial sequence number to suppose 300.
this 300 sequence number indicates that the next byte of data to be received will start here.

Host B also sets acknowledgement flag to 101
an acknowledgement flag indicates the next portion of data it will receive.


Step3
Host A receives SYN from host B
sends back tcp segment session established
CONTROL = ACK = 1 , and SYN=0

ON HOST A
ACK = 301
SEQ = 101

BECAUSE SYN FLAG IS UNSET, THIS CONFIRMS THAT 3 WAY HANDSHAKE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY.

assuming that window size of 1 is used.
it is max amount of data that receiver can recieve ( asssume that only 1 segment can be transmitted)


A SEQ=5 -----------> B ACKNUM=6 , SEQ NUM = 10

A SEQ NUM = 6 , ACK NUM= 11 -----------------> B

A <------------------------------ B SEQ NUM = 11, ACK NUM = 7

SEQUENCE NUMBERS MAY DIFFER
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT NUMBERS INIDCATE NEXT SEQUENCE NUMBER THAT HOST EXPECT TO RECEIVE.


fLOW CONTROL
prevents the issue of a sender overflowing the buffers of a receiver.


assume that window size is 3

A can send 3 segments of data before getting acknowledgement. so throughput is increased and round trip time is decreased.

receive buffer of B is full and B cannot handle the data being received.

So B will send not ready flag and setting window size to 0.

now B receive buffer is ready. B can send a ready indicator to tell a to resume sending of datagrams.
