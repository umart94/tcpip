minimum window size can be 1
this reduces the throughput.
because it needs to receive acknowledgement of that segment.

TCP allows for greater window sizes to allow more segments to be sent

window is number of data segments the sender is allowed to send without getting an acknowledgement.


A needs to buffer outgoing segments until it receives acknowledgement.

If window Size is set to 1

1 second to transfer from a to b
1 second to transfer from b to a

if a sends 3 segments to b
it will take 6 seconds 

Flow control - Fixed window Size.

if window size is set to 3

if 3 segments sent in 1 second
and b acknowledgement is 1 second.

even if there is a delay of 1 second.
it will take at max 3 seconds.

so time decreased from 6 to 3 seconds.

Sliding window allows hosts to gauge the amount of data hosts can receive.

when a packet is dropped by network, the hosts will slow down. and reduce the window size.

Window size is either the window size granted to the sender
or congestion window (CWND)

CWND is initially set to a very low value and then increases at exponential rate.

Weighted Random Early Detection. improves efficiency of tcp transmission

this avoids global synchronization issue.
