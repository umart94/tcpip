When a PC is connecting to a server on the internet. traffic will be sent from a source ip address to a destination ip adddress.

SA : 10.1.1.1
DA : 10.1.2.1

server needs to differentiate which application to send this traffic to
well known port numbers are used for various applications

port 80 used for http e.g
Apache server on the server PC will be listening for network traffic on port 80 of server.

Our source PC will open a connection to the server on that servers IP and Port number automatically ( from our application on the Client PC)


When that traffic arrives at the transport layer TCP will send that traffic to port 80,and send it to apache server application that was listening for network traffic.
which will process this data.

PC will use a random source port number in a range.
RANDOM port number is used for source.

When reply from server is sent back to PC

Source will now be Server IP , port 80
and Destination will be client IP and that random port

PC web browser on client will be listening on the random port for http traffic. TCP will push that traffic to this random port on application layer.

well known port numbers <=1023

APPLICATION = HTTP = PORT NUMBER 80 = TCP TRANSPORT LAYER PROTOCOL
APPLICATION = FTP = PORT NUMBER 21 = TCP TRANSPORT LAYER PROTOCOL
APPLICATION = FTP DATA = PORT NUMBER 20 = TCP TRANSPORT LAYER PROTOCOL
APPLICATION = TELNET = PORT NUMBER 23 = TCP TRANSPORT LAYER PROTOCOL
APPLICATION = DNS = PORT NUMBER 53 = TCP/UDP TRANSPORT LAYER PROTOCOL (USES BOTH TCP AND UDP) typically udp is used. but when response size increases more than 512 bits then TCP used.
or for tasks such as zone transfers for replication of databases containing dns data across dns servers.
APPLICATION = TFTP = PORT NUMBER 69 = UDP USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL
APPLICATION = SNMP = PORT NUMBER 161 = UDP USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL


well known port numbers <=1023
registered ports - 1024 to 49151
Dynamically assigned ports - 49152 to 65535


Ephemeral port numbers are short lived ports used for client side of the connection
temporary and only last for duration of the session
IANA range - 49152 to 65535
BSD uses ports 1024 - to 4999
Linux uses ports 32768 to 61000
Windows through server 2003 uses 1025 to 5000
vista / windows 7 uses IANA range. - IANA range - 49152 to 65535
free BSD uses iana range since release 4.6 -IANA range - 49152 to 65535
