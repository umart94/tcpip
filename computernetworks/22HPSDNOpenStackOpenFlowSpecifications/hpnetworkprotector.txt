hp network protector / sentinel
intercepts dns queries checks them against a tipping point database

makes sure that users are not going to malicious websites


Network Protector application is installed on controller
and it used java based api for the controller.


the application also references a copy of the tipping point databases
that contains a million website entries.


the controller uses openflow to update the switches
to intercept dns queries


if a pc is in the network and sends dns request for a bad malicious website

like suppose 

www.maliciouswebsite.com at 1.2.3.4

then

www.maliciouswebsite.com at 1.2.3.4 is a bad or malicious website we dont want
user to visit this.


the dns query for www.maliciouswebsite.com at 1.2.3.4


arrives at the switch

the APPLICATION using java api to the CONTROLLER has already pre programmed a 

flow entry, that says when The SWITCH receives a dns query, send it to the controller.


STEPS :

1. WHEN PC SENDS DNS QUERY TO www.maliciouswebsite.com at 1.2.3.4 TO SWITCH
2. THIS DNS QUERY IS SENT TO THE CONTROLLER 
3. THE CONTROLLER SENDS THE QUERY TO THE NETWORK PROTECTOR APPLICATION
4. THE NETWORK PROTECTOR APPLICATION SENDS THE REQUEST TO THE TIPPING POINT DATABASE
5. RETURNED BACK FROM TIPPING DATABASE TO NETWORK PROTECTOR APPLICATION AS BAD
WEBSITE
6. THE APPLICATION THEN SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE CONTROLLER AND IT TRAVELS 
7. TO THE CLIENT PC THAT THE WEBSITE IS MALICIOUS
8. PC believes it has gotten a response from dns HOWEVER this is a response from the Network protector application.



THE REQUEST DOES NOT GO TO THE SWITCH , AND THE REQUEST DOES NOT GO OVER TO AN ACTUAL DNS SERVER.


the network protector has fabricated a dns response and intercepted it and sent 
a response back to the pc that this is a non existent domain.



if dns request arrives for a good website, THEN the controller forwards it to the switch, and the switch then forwards to the dns server


the dns server then sends response back to the switch and switch then sends the response back to the PC.


hybrid processing , switch has its own decisions. and network protector uses its own databases.
