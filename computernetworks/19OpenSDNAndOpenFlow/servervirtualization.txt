we still configure ospf in same way as we did in the past.
PCs, or servers

write an application that uses network.
 for an OS that uses windows or linux or some os.

this OS abstracts the physical hardware from the application developer.

suppose the app runs in

hp laptops
dell laptops
vms

we dont need to be aware of NIC used on these machines
we write an app that uses an api used by the operating system.

os hides complexities of nic, memory, and other physical characteristics of hardware.

virtual machine portability from 1 os and 1 platform to another

for example we can convert a vmware vmx and virtual disk virtual machine to some other operating system and use it there



this type of portability does not exist inside a networking environment , yet..
