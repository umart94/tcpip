OPENFLOW PROTOCOL TO ACCESS NETWORK DEVICE HARDWARE
------------------------------------
NETWORK HARDWARE.


WE USE HIGH level api rest / java api to communicate to controller
and controller will then take care of updating the flow tables on the network devices.





in an openflow sdn environment we have a controller

previously , without sdn, we had local control plane on each seperate device

using openflow and opensdn, we now have a single controller that will control
all the networking devices.


this provides a centralized device for centralized control, policies and management.


previously we had 100 seperate autonomous access points. (each with local control plane)

now we have lots of lightweight access points, controlled by a central controller.


its easier to manage 100 access points using a centralized controller.


centralized controller pushing policies or config changes to network devices.

we can have an application, we send commands using that application to the controller

that sends the commands update flow tables on switches which in turn manipulate the flow of traffic
on the network. (diagram above)

i can create an application that sends a command through rest api to the controller
which then updates the switches using openflow that now says that traffic arriving with mac address of A 
going to mac address of B should flow around network through this path.



in open sdn and open flow

networking devices no longer have seperate local control planes.
