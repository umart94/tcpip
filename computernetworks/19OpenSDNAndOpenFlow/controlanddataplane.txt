for e.g. a company has 3 switches or 3 routers each device has a local control 
plane and local data plane

a device with a local control plane has a local routing table
local rib
protocols like ospf are configured on these devices to update the routing table

OSPF is a distributed routing protocol that is run on each device and exchanges routes
between the devices to allow them to work out what the topology of the
network looks like.


in a traditional environment, the control plane runs locally on each seperate device
each device has a local control plane.

this is a complex way and there is no single device that has an overview
of the entire network.

each device has to work out independently what the network looks like.

and together they synchronize a link state database which is the state of
the topology at a given point in time.

if we have multiple networking devices from a management point of view using
the Command Line interface we would have to CONNECT TO EACH SEPERATE DEVICE USING CLI AND CONFIGURE EACH 
SEPERATE DEVICE ON THE NETWORK.

each device also has a local data plane, a data plane is how the network packets
are forwarded through the device.
