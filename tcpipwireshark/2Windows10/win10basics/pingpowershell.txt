ipconfig /all

AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNED IPS

The ipconfig command supports the command-line switch /all. This results in more detailed information than ipconfig alone.

An important additional feature of ipconfig is to force refreshing of the DHCP IP address of the host computer to request a different IP address. 
This is done using two commands in sequence. First, ipconfig /release is executed to force the client to immediately give up its lease by sending the server a DHCP release notification 
which updates the server's status information and marks the old client's IP address as "available". Then, the command ipconfig /renew is executed to request a new IP address.
[3][4] Where a computer is connected to a cable or DSL modem, it may have to be plugged directly into the modem network port to bypass the router, before using ipconfig /release 
and turning off the power for a period of time, to ensure that the old IP address is taken by another computer.[5]

The /flushdns parameter can be used to clear the Domain Name System (DNS) cache to ensure future requests use fresh DNS information by 
forcing hostnames to be resolved again from scratch

WILL WORK
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew





a static assigned ip cannot be released or renewed (i.e. if DHCP is not enabled. and you manually set the ip)
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
will not work
