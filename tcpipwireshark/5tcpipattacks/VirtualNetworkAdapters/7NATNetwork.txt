Network Address Translation is Different

And NATNetwork is Different

Ok So in default mode remember that :

In this NAT NETWORKING MODE THERE WILL BE :
1. No Access from Outside Network Into This Virtual Machine.
2. No Network Between Host And Virtual Machine.
3. No Network Between Virtual Machines Themselves.

THERE WILL ONLY BE :
4. [YES] Access the Outside network using host as proxy.



we still do not have network between virtual machines themselves.

now we worked through ssh , host -> vm

now we want vm -> vm connections

so VM1,VM2,VM3 etc. will be on the same INTERNAL NETWORK. using A "NATNetwork" Adapter.



in NAT, each virtual machine had a seperate ip and was a seperate desktop computer and
its address was being translated to host computer. AS SEPERATE PRIVATE IP BEING ASSIGNED ON
HOST MACHINE.




IN NATNETWORK THERE WILL BE :

1. [YES] Access from Outside Network Into This Virtual Machine.
2. [YES] Network Between Host And Virtual Machine.
3. [YES] Network Between Virtual Machines Themselves.
4. [YES] Access the Outside network using host as proxy.


go to file preferences network -> create new NATNetwork
Network CIDR configure and DHCP Settings


Now when we go to network adapters and select NAT Network select network that we just created.
