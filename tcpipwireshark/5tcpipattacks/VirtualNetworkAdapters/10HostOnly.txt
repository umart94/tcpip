in HOST ONLY MODE

in addition to creating an internal network , HOST ONLY MODE ALSO ALLOWS CONNECTION TO THE HOST

VIRTUAL BOX CREATES A SEPERATE NETWORK ADAPTER FOR THE HOST TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNAL 
HOST-ONLY NETWORK.

WE can create multiple Host only networks.


add Host Only Network Adapter in virtual machine settings network


in HOST ONLY NETWORK :
1. [NO] Access from outside network
2. [YES] Network between Host and VM
3. [YES] Network between VMs
4. [NO] Access to external network / internet.


VMs connect to 192.168.56.1 Host Only Network Adapter.
this adapter is on the Host, called Virtual Box Host-Only Adapter

Host Only Network IP Range is 192.168.56.*


So we are unable to connect to any external network through pc host adapter
but we are ABLE to communicate between virtual machines, and between host and vm.


in this mode, locally ping and ICMP should work from host to VM and vm to host

but External network will not work inside the virtual machine.
