Network Address Translation is default for all VirtualBox Network Adapters.

VirtualBox Shields VM behind a Host IP.
VM connects to external world by translating it's own IP to the HOST IP using it as a proxy.

in NAT, VirtualBox creates an INTERNAL NETWORK For Each VM.
it will then map the IP addresses of the VMs to the Host IP using
VirtualBox NAT engine whenever the VM needs to contact the outside world.

Virtual Machine -> VM NAT Network Adapter(10.0.2.4) ->  (Gateway)VirtualBoxNAT Engine 10.0.2.2 -> Address Translated To Host IP -> PC Host Adapter (192.168.100.4) acts as device on host.


enp0s3 is the internal network created by virtualbox.... it has a ip 10.0.2.4 which is mapped to
192.168.100.4 (shown above)

The VirtualBOXNat Engine acts as a Virtualized Router. IT RUNS ON THE HOST !!!! it translates this IP Address
Assigned BY VM NAT Network Adapter to a HOST IP on PC Host Adapter (192.168.100.4) acts as device on host.

if there are multiple virtual machines, for each virtual machine there will be seperate internal NAT Networks. and Seperate NAT Adapters.

In this NAT NETWORKING MODE THERE WILL BE :
1. No Access from Outside Network Into This Virtual Machine.
2. No Network Between Host And Virtual Machine.
3. No Network Between Virtual Machines Themselves.

THERE WILL ONLY BE :
4. [YES] Access the Outside network using host as proxy.


---------------------------


To ACCESS THE VIRTUAL MACHINE IN NAT NETWORKING MODE THROUGH : 
1. HOST
2. EXTERNAL NETWORK


WE NEED TO USE PORT FORWARDING.

when we ENABLE PORT FORWARDING, VIRTUALBOXNAT ENGINE KNOWS THAT : 

Whenever the host adapter receives a packet on a predefined port number, it has to forward that packet TO THE VM
BY REVERSE TRANSLATING THAT IP AND PORT NUMBER.

so for example we NEED TO SSH INTO A VIRTUAL MACHINE FROM HOST TO VIRTUAL MACHINE.

go to Virtual machine settings -> network -> nat -> port forwarding -> rules -> add rule.

Rule1
Name
Protocol : TCP
Host IP : 
Host Port : 1234
GuestIP : 
Guest Port : 22


So we are on Windows Host using PuTTy
and in Virtual machine we have SSH service running on port 22 , The standard TCP port for SSH is 22


in the SSH connection : 

1. All packets are sent to IP:PORT i.e 192.168.100.4:1234 through PC Host Adapter.
2. the PC Host Adapter forwards it to the VirtualBoxNAT engine on the HOST.
3. The VirtualBoxNat Engine forwards these packets to port 22 on IP ADDRESS assigned to the Virtual Machine

i.e 10.0.2.4:22

Layer 4 is Application Layer : we are using SSH and TCP port 22
ICMP is Layer 3 protocol : ping is on layer 3 (ICMP)
ping wont work. but we use layer4 ssh connection.
