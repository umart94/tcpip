Attack Lab Final Project

In this project we have written a lab for students about a simple ransomware attack.
In this lab the student will get familiar with the concepts of cryptography, and create a ransomware attack step-by-step.
The lab and all the relevant information about the environment needed can be seen inside 'Ransomware Lab Attack.pdf' .
