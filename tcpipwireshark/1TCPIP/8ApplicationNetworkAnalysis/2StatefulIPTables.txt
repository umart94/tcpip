Stateful Firewall
IP Tables

iptables is a command line interface used to set up and maintain tables for the Netfilter firewall for IPv4, included in the Linux kernel. The firewall matches packets with rules defined in these tables and then takes the specified action on a possible match.

Tables is the name for a set of chains.
Chain is a collection of rules.
Rule is condition used to match packet.
Target is action taken when a possible rule matches. Examples of the target are ACCEPT, DROP, QUEUE.
Policy is the default action taken in case of no match with the inbuilt chains and can be ACCEPT or DROP.

we configure it using text rules

append to output chain (rule chains)
rule chains for input output and forwarding

this will affect TCP traffic going out
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -j DROP

telnet www.google.com 80
get
any new outgoing traffic will be blocked

to remove the rule , flush the rule

sudo iptables -F
telnet www.google.com 80
now we get


list all rules.

sudo iptables -L -v
this will affect ICMP (e.g ping) traffic going out
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -m state --state NEW -j DROP


Filtering based on ports


sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED

any state will be disabled if it is on port 80

telnet www.google.com 80
telnet www.google.com 443
will work
