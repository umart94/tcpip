ipv6 more common in mobile network providers.
USA (Verizon Wireless – 84%, Sprint – 70%, T-Mobile USA – 93%, and AT&T Wireless – 57%) 
national mobile networks have very high levels of IPv6 deployment.

Google reports 49 countries using IPv6 for more than 5% of their interactions with them (up from 37 in 2017). APNIC, Akamai and Facebook report similar numbers of countries accessing their services using IPv6.


Domain Name System (DNS)
In the root domain, which is to say the service that provides the addresses for top-level domains (TLDs) such as .com, .org, .us, or .io, there are twelve companies operating thirteen root server identities (Verisign operates two). Each of these identities is dual stacked; it has both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.

There are 1,543 TLDs, of which 98.4% (1519) have IPv6 name server addresses and can be queried using either IPv4 or IPv6; an ICANN requirement of all new TLDs is that they be IPv6-capable from the day they launch.

--------------

IPv6 is short for "Internet Protocol version 6". IPv6 is the "next generation" protocol designed by the IETF to replace the current version of Internet_Protocol, IP Version 4 or IPv4.

IPv6 was initially designed with a compelling reason in mind: the need for more IP addresses. This need arose from fast Internet growth: billions of new devices (cell phones, PDAs, appliances, cars, etc.), and billions of new users (China, India, Latin America). This, combined with new 'always-on' access technologies such as xDSL, cable, ethernet-to-the-home, were increasing the appetite for new devices and new users.

There may be alternative technical solutions, such as NAT (Network Address Translation), but they won't work so easily to allow this growth. <!-- what's this have to do with IPv6?: Furthermore, those alternative solutions make the Internet, the applications, and even the devices more complex; this means increased costs. On the other hand, IPv6 can make, in the medium/long-term, every IP device cheaper, more powerful, and even consume less power (which is important not only for ecologic conservation, but also to have longer battery life in portable devices such as cell phones). -->

Consequently, the design of IPv6 was an opportunistic way to improve the Internet, with new benefits such as:

Expanded addressing capabilities.
Server-less autoconfiguration ("plug-n-play") and reconfiguration.
More efficient and robust mobility mechanisms.
End-to-end security, with built-in, strong IP-layer encryption and authentication.
Streamlined header format and flow identification.
Enhanced support for multicast and QoS.
Extensibility: Improved support for options / extensions.
History
The History of IPv6 started in 1994-1995 with documents such as: RFC1719 "A Direction for IPng", RFC1726 "Technical Criteria for Choosing IP The Next Generation (IPng)" and RFC1752 RFC1752 "The Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol".

Then the main document was published in December 1995: RFC1883 "Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification".

Which was obsoleted in December 1998 by: RFC2460"Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification".

Protocol dependencies
Ethernet: Typically, IPv6 uses Ethernet as its transport protocol.

IPv6 can be transported over a wide variety of other protocols as well.

--------------------------------

3 way handshakes are same as ipv4

only change is that we have to change server config
we have to also change dns settings ( those that support ipv6 lookups )
