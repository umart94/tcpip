used by large service providers
it is a distance vector routing protocol

information is shared between routers to get to a path, as well as how to get there

By using Metrics and Rules :

open bgp.pcap

line 5 -> info -> elatelink > bgp. we are opening a bgp session

5	7.999977	192.168.0.15	192.168.0.33	TCP	74	2124 â†’ 179 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=32120 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=181687325 TSecr=0 WS=1

this is a synchronize message , the bgp port is Dst Port : bgp (179)
BGP uses TCP messages to transfer data between neighbour routers

we configure routers to be neighbours, and someone we can share router information with
from 5 to 6 to 7 there is a 3 way handshake ending with ACK.

bgp can be slow because we have to set up this connection
afterwards the message is originating from verified router devices.
bgp is more secure than other routing protocols.

routing area that exists within particular network... ip addresses and blocks that the network knows about.
these pieces of information are shared with neighbour routers.

keep alives : connection between 2 routers stays online

--------
update message : information about a particular network, how far it would be, and information about it

    Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)
        10.0.0.0/8

network to reach is 10.0.0.0/8

local pref = 100 is weight that is assigned

1 hop knows about the network
we need to update Routing tables.
no ASPATH in this case

192.168.0.33 knows about network 10.0.0.0/8
192.168.0.15 will update routing table based on this information
so that if it receives any message about network 10.0.0.0/8
it will send it to 192.168.0.33

this is implemented at large scale service providers
IBGP , EBGP (interior , exterior)
also interacts with other service providers.
internal is for internal service provider only.
