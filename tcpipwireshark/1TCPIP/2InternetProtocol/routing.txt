routing gets packets from 1 network to another network

192.168.1.22
netmask 0xffffff00 255.255.255.0

first 3 octets 192.168.1 belong to network
4th octet is host

this is network masking and subnet masking
this tells us which range of ips are on which networks

--------------------------

view routing tables
netstat -rn (cmd)

 Type in `route print -4.`

The ‘-4’ specifies the IPv4 routing table and not the IPv6. Using that switch will simplify the output.

--------------------------
any route that we do not know about, we first send it to default gateway.

traceroute ipaddress (apple shell)
tracert ipaddress (windows cmd)

first it will hop to default gateway
then it hops over routers to get from Point A to Point B.
the first hop/step is always default gateway
