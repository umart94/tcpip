ipconfig

ipconfig /all

---------------
physical networking medium accepts what size of data ?

size of data we can send vs size of data network will accept

Ethernet -> 1500 bytes with headers
IP Packet -> 64K Bytes

IP Packet / Datagram is fragmented.
--------------------------------

ping -h
Bad option -h.

Usage: ping [-t] [-a] [-n count] [-l size] [-f] [-i TTL] [-v TOS]
            [-r count] [-s count] [[-j host-list] | [-k host-list]]
            [-w timeout] [-R] [-S srcaddr] [-c compartment] [-p]
            [-4] [-6] target_name

Options:
    -t             Ping the specified host until stopped.
                   To see statistics and continue - type Control-Break;
                   To stop - type Control-C.
    -a             Resolve addresses to hostnames.
    -n count       Number of echo requests to send.
    -l size        Send buffer size.
    -f             Set Don't Fragment flag in packet (IPv4-only).
    -i TTL         Time To Live.
    -v TOS         Type Of Service (IPv4-only. This setting has been deprecated
                   and has no effect on the type of service field in the IP
                   Header).
    -r count       Record route for count hops (IPv4-only).
    -s count       Timestamp for count hops (IPv4-only).
    -j host-list   Loose source route along host-list (IPv4-only).
    -k host-list   Strict source route along host-list (IPv4-only).
    -w timeout     Timeout in milliseconds to wait for each reply.
    -R             Use routing header to test reverse route also (IPv6-only).
                   Per RFC 5095 the use of this routing header has been
                   deprecated. Some systems may drop echo requests if
                   this header is used.
    -S srcaddr     Source address to use.
    -c compartment Routing compartment identifier.
    -p             Ping a Hyper-V Network Virtualization provider address.
    -4             Force using IPv4.
    -6             Force using IPv6.

------------------------------------------
l flag for size. 3100 is buffer size
ping -l 3100 gateway

Pinging gateway with 3100 bytes of data:
Request timed out.
Request timed out.
Request timed out.
Request timed out.

Ping statistics for gateway:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 0, Lost = 4 (100% loss),

---------------------------------------

IP IDENTIFICATION NUMBER
FRAGMENT OFFSET. 1480 bytes
starts from 0
1480 bytes went into 1
next 1480 gives 2960 - with 20 bytes of header. and so on
incremented with each size increase / (fragment offset)
fragments are based on the maximum transmission unit of underlying networking protocol ( in this case ehternet.. mtu is 1500 bytes)
