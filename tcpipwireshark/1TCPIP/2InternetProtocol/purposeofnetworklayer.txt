Why use IP Addresses ?

Src:

Dst:

suppose 2 ips on same network.. we send messages between 2 machines on same network

incase of seperate networks -> this layer forwards packets from 1 network to another
WITH different gateways / different IP Addresses / Different Subnets Etc.

routing / forwarding of packets / and addressing
----------------------------------------------

IP Address = logical address and
MAC Address = Physical Address


MAC Addresses are globally unique
they are all different and unique depending on vendors (MANUFACTURERS)

first 3 segments same in an ipaddress means they are on same network

-----------
L2

MAC Addresses don't have this (Logical) definition of addresses. we can work locally but not on seperate networks (L2)
