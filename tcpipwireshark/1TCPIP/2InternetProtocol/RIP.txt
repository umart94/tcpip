Routing Information Protocol - very old , not used in large organizations , used in small networks that don't require admin.

distance vector protocol - > uses hop count
we have a distance, and we have hop count ( intermediate systems ) and vectors that gives us interface 
that is used to know how to reach from point a to point b

----------
split horizon -> prevent incorrect routing information , keeps routing loops from happening
we don't send the message back out from that interface

------

RIP sends out routing tables / partial routing tables
so the entries increase

Split horizon is a method to not enter duplicate entries, incase our network already knows about a destination
we don't need to add it again.

RIP_v1 --- Request

Routing Information Protocol
    Command: Request (1)
    Version: RIPv1 (1)
    Address not specified, Metric: 16
        Address Family: Unspecified (0)
        Metric: 16



-----------------------

RIP_v1 --- Response

Routing Information Protocol
    Command: Response (2)
    Version: RIPv1 (1)
    IP Address: 200.0.1.0, Metric: 1
        Address Family: IP (2)
        IP Address: 200.0.1.0
        Metric: 1

metric 1 means its 1 hop away.


no indication of how big this network is
RIP makes assumptions of network size based on the 1st octet
A -- 0 to 127
B -- 128 to 191
C -- 192 to 223

RIP assumes network mask for ip address to be 255.255.255.0 for the ip 200.0.2.0

it does not have this ability (to assume network mask ) for classless addresses.
no authentication ( only requests and responses ) to broadcast addresses. to detect whether message comes from the right source address
