Force PROT P to encrypt file transfers when using FTP over TLS
Require TLS Session resumption on data connection when using prot p

PROT P refers to the data transfers. Communication with the server is always encrypted if you use FTP over TLS.
Communication encrypted: PROT C, Communication+Data encrypted: PROT P.

If PROT P isn't enforced, client could send PROT C and transfer files unencrypted. If PROT P is enforced, PROT C is rejected.
