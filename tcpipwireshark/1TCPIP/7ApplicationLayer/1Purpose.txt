Application level handling is done at application layer.
anything not handled by any other layers , gets handled at application layer

e.g
remote login
telnet , ssh
file transfers ftp,tftp

smtp , pop

server message block protocol -> transfer files 
dns -> app level protocol -> lookup ip addresses from hostnames
retransmissions etc.


application layer implements the SMTP , IMAP , POP protocol
Email Clients then send message to lower layer
