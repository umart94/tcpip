ncat -C www.google.com 80
GET /foo-foo-blah HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

in this case , browser sends an additional get request incase of 404 page, ( the error page that needs to be displayed)

we could also get a 300 series message.
or a 500 message.

HTTP is application layer protocol, ( we handle which error page to show )
