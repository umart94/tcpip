sudo ifconfig

find your kali vm private ip.

You can do this by configuring port forwarding on the NAT network configuration.

You forgot to mention the product you are using, but if it is VMware Workstation Professional then you can set the port forwarding as follows:

Go to the menu -> Edit -> Virtual Network Editor
Select the row with "VMNET8 NAT NAT "
Click on the button "NAT Settings"
Button "Add"
Here you can add the port on your host that you want to accept your SSH on. I would suggest to use something else as 22, so that your host can use SSH if needed. So for example enter 2022 for the host port.
Add the virtual machine IP address
Add virtual machine port 22
Add a description
Click OK

You should now be able to access the VM via SSH by connecting to your host on port 2022.

First Method:

USING BRIDGED ADAPTER

Setup your SSH in the host machine:

Open your terminal and run this command to set up ssh properly:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 # generates ssh key so others know you, add values, but leave the default setup location
ssh-add   # adds it to the client
Using Network Bridged Adapter settings:

Go to the Settings --> Network choose the device name, in my case eth0
Choose Bridged Adapter for option Attached to

Note: no need to switch off or shutdown the VM it will pick up the new settings
Go to your Ubuntu virtual machine from the terminal run:

ifconfig
look for the IP address associated with the network device (not lo device)
Now back in the host machine connect to Ubuntu virtual machine using the IP gotten in step 3:

ssh -l <user_name_of_vm_user> <IP_address> #OR

ssh <user_name_of_vm_user>@<IP_address>
Second method:

USING NAT ADAPTER

Setup your SSH in the host machine:

Open your terminal and run this command to set up ssh properly:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 # generates ssh key so others know you, add values, but leave the default setup location
ssh-add   #adds it to the client
Using Network NAT Adapter settings:

Go to the Settings --> Network choose NAT (which is the default)
Select Advanced option
Select Port Forwarding
Add the following to the table that appears:

Name: any name you like
Protocol: leave as is or change
Host ip: ignore
Host port: any number say 3003 (but not one already being used in host)
Guest ip: ignore
Guest port: 22

enter image description here

Note: no need to switch off or shutdown the VM it will pick up the new settings
Now back in the host machine connect to Ubuntu virtual machine using the IP gotten in step 3:

ssh -p 3003 -l <user_name_of_vm_user> 127.0.0.1 #OR

ssh -p 3003 <user_name_of_vm_user>@127.0.0.1
Note:

Free ports chosen if using firewall both on host and guest
