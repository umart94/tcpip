making sure that both ends of communication realize that the other end is not going to transmit data any longer.
once data is being transmitted, It is Bi-Directional Data, with requests and responses going back and fwd.

we need something to determine that communication has finally stopped. (SessionTearDown)

both sides can be a sender or receiver. so we need to "Teardown the session from both sides."
