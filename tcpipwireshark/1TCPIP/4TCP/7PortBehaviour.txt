HOST DISCOVERY:
  -sL: List Scan - simply list targets to scan
  -sn: Ping Scan - disable port scan
  -Pn: Treat all hosts as online -- skip host discovery
  -PS/PA/PU/PY[portlist]: TCP SYN/ACK, UDP or SCTP discovery to given ports
  -PE/PP/PM: ICMP echo, timestamp, and netmask request discovery probes
  -PO[protocol list]: IP Protocol Ping
  -n/-R: Never do DNS resolution/Always resolve [default: sometimes]
  --dns-servers <serv1[,serv2],...>: Specify custom DNS servers
  --system-dns: Use OS's DNS resolver
  --traceroute: Trace hop path to each host
SCAN TECHNIQUES:
  -sS/sT/sA/sW/sM: TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans
  -sU: UDP Scan
  -sN/sF/sX: TCP Null, FIN, and Xmas scans
  --scanflags <flags>: Customize TCP scan flags
  -sI <zombie host[:probeport]>: Idle scan
  -sY/sZ: SCTP INIT/COOKIE-ECHO scans
  -sO: IP protocol scan
  -b <FTP relay host>: FTP bounce scan
PORT SPECIFICATION AND SCAN ORDER:
  -p <port ranges>: Only scan specified ports
    Ex: -p22; -p1-65535; -p U:53,111,137,T:21-25,80,139,8080,S:9
  --exclude-ports <port ranges>: Exclude the specified ports from scanning
  -F: Fast mode - Scan fewer ports than the default scan
  -r: Scan ports consecutively - don't randomize
  --top-ports <number>: Scan <number> most common ports
  --port-ratio <ratio>: Scan ports more common than <ratio>

-sT TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans
-p <port ranges>: Only scan specified ports

nmap -sT -p 20,21,22,23,25,53,67,68,80,110,119,123,143,161,194,443,3389 YOUR_PRIVATE_IP

Starting Nmap some version ( https://nmap.org ) at some date some time

Nmap scan report for YOUR_PRIVATE_IP
Host is up.



PORT     STATE    SERVICE
yahan ports with states and services show honge.
Nmap done: abc IP address (def host up) scanned in xyz seconds

The state is either open, filtered, closed, or unfiltered. 

Open means that an application on the target machine is listening for connections/packets on that port. 

Filtered means that a firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is open or closed. 

Closed ports have no application listening on them, though they could open up at any time. 

Ports are classified as unfiltered when they are responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are open or closed. Nmap reports the state combinations open|filtered and closed|filtered when it cannot determine which of the two states describe a port. The port table may also include software version details when version detection has been requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested (-sO), Nmap provides information on supported IP protocols rather than listening ports.


we can compare nmaps result with wireshark result.
in TCP portion of the capture, see Src Port and Dst Port. Port states should match

a closed port, on network capture , will give the RST,ACK packet.
this is the RESET Flag. 0x14

if port is closed, RFC specifies that it should send a RESET.

but we don't want this incase adversaries are attacking a system. so what we can do

in case of someone scanning our ports. is drop those packets. and do not send a respond back
( any kind of response ) 



Open port -> 3 way handshake


Closed Port -> RESET


Filtered Port -> the initial message gets dropped, no response is generated.
