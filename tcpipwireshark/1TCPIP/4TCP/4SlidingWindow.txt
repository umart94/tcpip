chunk of bytes that slide over the stream of data being sent.

Window size value : is the number of bytes that can be sent without receiving an acknowledgement.
Until we get ack, we cannot slide the window over the remaining bytes being sent

suppose some random bytes.

01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30


window : 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08

we get ack for :  03 04 05 06

until i get ack for the 01
i cannot slide the window over to next sequence of bytes.


now we get ack for : 01 02 03

now the window has slid over

window is opening in stream of data , it is only so many bytes long , it slides along as we receive acks for earliest bytes in the window

we can keep sliding window as we get the acks.

Window size value tells us the size
and we can set its value.

we can have different windows in different directions.
again we use the seq,ack numbers in combination with the window size.
so when we get acks for bytes, packets etc. we then slide the window in a certain direction.
