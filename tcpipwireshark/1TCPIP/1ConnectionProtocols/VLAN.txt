LAN - Physical Networks and Devices

VLAN - (Physical Networks) but instead of physical hardware we use
physical isolation between network segments

1 large switch -> connect computers -> set up different ports on the switch so
different PCS will be on different

802.1Q Virtual LAN, PRI: 0, DEI: 0, ID: 118
    000. .... .... .... = Priority: Best Effort (default) (0)
    ...0 .... .... .... = DEI: Ineligible
    .... 0000 0111 0110 = ID: 118
    Type: 802.1Q Virtual LAN (0x8100)
802.1Q Virtual LAN, PRI: 0, DEI: 0, ID: 10
Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: 10.118.10.1, Dst: 10.118.10.2
Internet Control Message Protocol

802.1Q tag (tagged / flagged vlans as being part of this tag -> switch knows which packet belongs to which vlan tag)
118 is number of the vlan
give ids to different vlans

departmentwise
department1 gets 118
department2 gets 2
department3 gets 10

so vlan tag 118 sends to vlan tag 10
the broadcast / unicast traffic is handled by switch / through ports that belong to those vlans

etc.
