WAN Protocols - Sonet - ATM - Frame Relay

--------------------------------------------
protocols for sending huge amounts of data

Synchronous Optical Networking - SONET
Its optical
rather than headers and payload

headers are interleaved with payload

--------------------------------------------

Asynchronous Transfer Mode
ISDN
ISDN is a circuit-switched telephone network system, 
which also provides access to packet switched networks, 
designed to allow digital transmission of voice and data over ordinary telephone copper wires,
 resulting in potentially better voice quality than an analog phone can provide

FIXED LENGTH CELLS INSTEAD OF VARIABLE LENGTH PACKETS

small sized cells
5byte header
48 byte payload
53 byte cell


--------------------------------------------

Frame Relay - Network Provider / Phone Company
connect to their frame relay switches and they handle communication
DTE Routers and DCE devices - WAN networking protocols - protocol data units / flag,address,information,frame check sequence fields

frame relay network adds these header bits
frame relay also does congestion control
