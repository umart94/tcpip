Layer 2 protocol PPP

Point to Point Protocol - identical to SLIP (Serial Line IP)
used in modems, capable of setting up connection btw devices ( between two routers directly without any host or any other networking in between  ) as well as encapsulate higher layer protocols

PPP frame
Structure

PPP frames are variants of HDLC frames:
Name 	Number of bytes 	Description
Flag 	1 	0x7E, the beginning of a PPP frame
Address 	1 	0xFF, standard broadcast address
Control 	1 	0x03, unnumbered data
Protocol 	2 	PPP ID of embedded data
Information 	variable (0 or more) 	datagram
Padding 	variable (0 or more) 	optional padding
Frame Check Sequence 	2 	frame checksum
Flag 	1 	0x7E, omitted for successive PPP packets 


Encapsulation

PPP frames are encapsulated in a lower-layer protocol that provides framing and may provide other functions such as a checksum to detect transmission errors. PPP on serial links is usually encapsulated in a framing similar to HDLC, described by IETF RFC 1662.
Name 	Number of bytes 	Description
Flag 	1 	indicates frame's begin or end
Address 	1 	broadcast address
Control 	1 	control byte
Protocol 	1 or 2 or 3 	l in information field
Information 	variable (0 or more) 	datagram
Padding 	variable (0 or more) 	optional padding
FCS 	2 (or 4) 	error check

md5 challenge -> authentication -> password

PPP / CHAP / PPP WITH EAP

in EAP -> value -> if request matches the response... we have a successfull authentication
after which transmission proceeds


PPP over Ethernet -> PPP over ATM

automatically configure connections between 2 different endpoints and handle authentication
