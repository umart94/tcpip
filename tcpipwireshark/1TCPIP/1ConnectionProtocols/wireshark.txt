unicast traffic : sent to one machine only
broadcast traffic : multiple systems and broad spectrum of hosts

wireshark by default puts network traffic in promiscuous mode , that means that we see all traffic on this network
if firewall or antivirus is enabled, it would affect promiscuous mode

Filter : tcp
will filter by tcp traffic
but we also see TLS as well, this means that we see other protocols that are on top of TCP ( tls encryption over tcp)

Filter : ip.addr == YOU_IP_ADDRESS_HERE

ipconfig /all

private ip assigned set to preferred / default


Filter : ip.src == your_ip_address_here

this will only sort packets by exact source id, and not any other traffic

we can also right click choose apply as filter and choose selected
this will sort packets out by only this type of packet

right click -> follow tcp stream
shows messages related to that tcp stream

double click -> http get request .. we see request and response of 200 ( pick any http traffic )
