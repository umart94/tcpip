Filter : tcp
will filter by tcp traffic
but we also see TLS as well, this means that we see other protocols that are on top of TCP ( tls encryption over tcp)

--------------------------------------------
Filter : ip.addr == your_ip_address_here

ipconfig /all

private ip assigned set to preferred / default


Filter : ip.src == your_ip_address_here

this will only sort packets by exact source id, and not any other traffic

we can also right click choose apply as filter and choose selected
this will sort packets out by only this type of packet

right click -> follow tcp stream
shows messages related to that tcp stream

double click -> http get request .. we see request and response of 200 ( pick any http traffic )

----------------------------------------------
tcp.stream eq 10

tcp.stream eq 8
It indicates that this is the 8th TCP or UDP stream found in the trace.

Before we had stream numbers a filter to identify the stream would specify a pair of IP addresses and port numbers, 
resulting in much longer display filters.

When tcp.stream was implemented, the number had no significance and would show some gaps. 
In recent (development) versions of Wireshark the number represents order in which wireshark detected tcp streams,
 the first gets tcp.stream==0, the next tcp.stream==1 etc.
