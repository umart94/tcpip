Bridged Adapters use the 'net-filter' driver on the HOST to directly intercept data packets.

VM uses net-filter Adapter. ON THE HOST to access Physical Ports on the HOST
this creates a new virtualized interface along with PC Host Adapter.
This enables Virtual Machines to Directly Communicate With Host Machine and enable routing and switching.


VM Settings -> Network -> Bridged Adapter

the ip will be assigned according to the Home Router Default Gateway. used by the HOST Machine i.e

HOST = 192.168.100.2
VM = 192.168.10.3

so by using Bridged Mode, we connected directly to the HOST Network.

and EVERY VIRTUAL MACHINE WILL CONNECT TO HOME ROUTER AS A NEW HOST COMPUTER.

we can assign static ip and manually assign dns. 


IN BRIDGED MODE:

1. [YES] ACCESS FROM OUTSIDE NETWORK
2. [YES] NETWORK BETWEEN HOST AND VM
3. [YES] NETWORK BETWEEN VMs
4. [YES] ACCESS TO EXTERNAL NETWORK / INTERNET.


this is a direct access to the network.
so the host network will be affected if anything fails.
